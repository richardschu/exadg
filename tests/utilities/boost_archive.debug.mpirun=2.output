Filling vector with ordered global indices [0, 35937).
Storing the vector in the archive.
    writing vector with global l2 norm: 3.9331729e+06
Reading the vector from the archive.
    read vector with global l2 norm: 3.9331729e+06
vector_out.linfty_norm() = 35936
vector_out.l2_norm()     = 3.9331729e+06

error in linfty_norm = 0
error in l2_norm     = 0
